        "4.  **Fluid Dynamics:** They are used to model potential flow in two dimensions.\n",
        "5.  **Control Systems:** Employed in stability analysis and design of control systems, using tools like Laplace transforms which operate in the complex domain.\n",

        "### Understanding Literals and Memory Optimization in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, a **literal** is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. For example, `10`, `3.14`, `'hello'`, `True`, `[1, 2]`, and `{'a': 1}` are all literals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your observation is keen: for certain types of literals, if you use the same value multiple times, Python might indeed **not create a new memory location** for each instance. This is due to an optimization technique called **interning** (or object reuse).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Python Interns Some Literals\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Small Integers:** Integers in the range of approximately -5 to 256 (this range can vary slightly by Python version or implementation, but is common) are typically pre-allocated when Python starts. Any time you create an integer literal within this range, Python reuses the existing object in memory.\n",
        "2.  **Short Strings:** Short string literals (usually less than 20 characters, often containing only alphanumeric and underscore characters, but the exact rules are complex and can vary) are also often interned. If two such strings have the exact same content, they will often point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "3.  **`None`, `True`, `False`:** These are singletons; there's only ever one instance of each in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "When objects are interned, they share the same memory address. You can verify this using the `id()` function, which returns the unique identity of an object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples of Interning (Object Reuse)\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Mutable Literals:** Objects like lists (`[]`), dictionaries (`{}`), and sets (`{1, 2}`) are mutable. Even if their contents are identical, each literal instance creates a distinct object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Larger/Complex Immutable Literals:** As seen with `a = 257` and `s3` above, once integers or strings fall outside the internally managed ranges/conditions, new objects are created.\n",
