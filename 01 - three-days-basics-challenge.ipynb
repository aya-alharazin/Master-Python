    "### Integer Immutability in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both integers and floating-point numbers (floats) are **immutable** data types. This means that once an integer or float object is created, its value cannot be changed. When you perform an operation that seems to modify an integer's or float's value (e.g., reassigning a variable), Python actually creates a *new* object with the new value, and the variable then refers to this new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can observe this behavior by using the built-in `id()` function, which returns the unique identity of an object. If a variable is reassigned to a new integer or float value, its `id()` will change, indicating that it now refers to a different object in memory.\n",

    "### Complex Numbers: Explanation and Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers are an extension of real numbers, incorporating an imaginary unit denoted by `i`, where `i^2 = -1`. A complex number is typically expressed in the form `a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers, and `j` (or `i` in mathematics) is the imaginary unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "*   **Real Part (a):** The component of the complex number that is a real number.\n",
    "*   **Imaginary Part (b):** The component multiplied by the imaginary unit `j`.\n",
    "*   **Imaginary Unit (j):** Defined as the square root of -1. In Python, it's represented as `j` (e.g., `3 + 5j`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where they are useful:**\n",
    "Complex numbers are indispensable in many fields, particularly in engineering, physics, and applied mathematics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Electrical Engineering (AC Circuits):** They simplify the analysis of alternating current (AC) circuits, allowing engineers to represent impedance, voltage, and current as complex numbers, making calculations for phase shifts and magnitudes more straightforward.\n",
    "2.  **Signal Processing:** Used extensively in Fourier analysis to transform signals between time and frequency domains. This is crucial for audio processing, image compression, and telecommunications.\n",
    "3.  **Quantum Mechanics:** Complex numbers form the fundamental mathematical framework for describing quantum states and wave functions.\n",
    "4.  **Fluid Dynamics:** They are used to model potential flow in two dimensions.\n",
    "5.  **Control Systems:** Employed in stability analysis and design of control systems, using tools like Laplace transforms which operate in the complex domain.\n",
    "6.  **Computer Graphics:** Used in transformations, rotations, and fractals (e.g., Mandelbrot set).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, complex numbers can be created using the `complex()` constructor or by directly writing them with the `j` suffix, as shown in the example below."

    "### Understanding Literals and Memory Optimization in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **literal** is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. For example, `10`, `3.14`, `'hello'`, `True`, `[1, 2]`, and `{'a': 1}` are all literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your observation is keen: for certain types of literals, if you use the same value multiple times, Python might indeed **not create a new memory location** for each instance. This is due to an optimization technique called **interning** (or object reuse).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Python Interns Some Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "Python performs interning for performance and memory efficiency, primarily for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Small Integers:** Integers in the range of approximately -5 to 256 (this range can vary slightly by Python version or implementation, but is common) are typically pre-allocated when Python starts. Any time you create an integer literal within this range, Python reuses the existing object in memory.\n",
    "2.  **Short Strings:** Short string literals (usually less than 20 characters, often containing only alphanumeric and underscore characters, but the exact rules are complex and can vary) are also often interned. If two such strings have the exact same content, they will often point to the same object in memory.\n",
    "3.  **`None`, `True`, `False`:** These are singletons; there's only ever one instance of each in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When objects are interned, they share the same memory address. You can verify this using the `id()` function, which returns the unique identity of an object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Interning (Object Reuse)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Small Integers\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "print(f\"x: {id(x)}, y: {id(y)}\") # Output: IDs will be the same\n",
    "print(x is y) # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 257 # Outside common interned range\n",
    "b = 257\n",
    "print(f\"a: {id(a)}, b: {id(b)}\") # Output: IDs are likely different\n",
    "print(a is b) # Output: False (usually)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Short Strings\n",
    "s1 = \"hello_world\"\n",
    "s2 = \"hello_world\"\n",
    "print(f\"s1: {id(s1)}, s2: {id(s2)}\") # Output: IDs will likely be the same\n",
    "print(s1 is s2) # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "s3 = \"this is a somewhat longer string literal for example\"\n",
    "s4 = \"this is a somewhat longer string literal for example\"\n",
    "print(f\"s3: {id(s3)}, s4: {id(s4)}\") # Output: IDs are likely different\n",
    "print(s3 is s4) # Output: False (usually)\n",

    "print(f\"p: {id(p)}, q: {id(q)}\") # Output: IDs will be the same\n",
    "print(p is q) # Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When Python Creates New Memory Locations (Without Interning)\n",
    "\n",
    "For other types of literals, or when certain conditions aren't met, Python will create new objects in memory even if their values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mutable Literals:** Objects like lists (`[]`), dictionaries (`{}`), and sets (`{1, 2}`) are mutable. Even if their contents are identical, each literal instance creates a distinct object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Larger/Complex Immutable Literals:** As seen with `a = 257` and `s3` above, once integers or strings fall outside the internally managed ranges/conditions, new objects are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Dynamically Created Objects:** If an object is created dynamically (e.g., as a result of an operation or function call, rather than a direct literal assignment), it will generally be a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of New Memory Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Mutable Lists\n",
    "l1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "l2 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(f\"l1: {id(l1)}, l2: {id(l2)}\") # Output: IDs will be different\n",

    "print(d1 is d2) # Output: False\n",
    "print(d1 == d2) # Output: True (values are equal)\n",

    "print(f1 is f2) # Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Python's memory management for literals is an optimization. While it reuses memory for certain common, immutable values to save resources, you should generally rely on `==` for value comparison and `is` only when you explicitly need to check if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory."

    "### Understanding the `range()` Function in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function is a built-in Python function that generates a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used in `for` loops to iterate a specific number of times. Importantly, `range()` does not return a list of numbers directly; instead, it returns an **iterable object** (a `range` object) which yields numbers one by one as you iterate over it. This makes it very memory-efficient, especially for large sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax and Forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "`range()` can be used in three different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`range(stop)`**: Generates a sequence of numbers starting from `0` (inclusive) up to, but not including, `stop` (exclusive). The step is `1` by default.\n",
    "    *   **Signature:** `range(stop)`\n",
    "    *   **Parameters:** `stop` (required) - an integer.\n",
    "    *   **Example:**\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        for i in range(5):\n",
    "            print(i, end=' ')\n",
    "        # Output: 0 1 2 3 4\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`range(start, stop)`**: Generates a sequence of numbers starting from `start` (inclusive) up to, but not including, `stop` (exclusive). The step is `1` by default.\n",
    "    *   **Signature:** `range(start, stop)`\n",
    "    *   **Parameters:** `start` (required), `stop` (required) - integers.\n",
    "    *   **Example:**\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        for i in range(2, 7):\n",
    "            print(i, end=' ')\n",
    "        # Output: 2 3 4 5 6\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`range(start, stop, step)`**: Generates a sequence of numbers starting from `start` (inclusive) up to, but not including, `stop` (exclusive), incrementing or decrementing by `step`.\n",
    "    *   **Signature:** `range(start, stop, step)`\n",
    "    *   **Parameters:** `start` (required), `stop` (required), `step` (required) - integers.\n",
    "    *   **Important:**\n",
    "        *   If `step` is positive, `start` must be less than `stop` for the sequence to be non-empty.\n",
    "        *   If `step` is negative, `start` must be greater than `stop` for the sequence to be non-empty.\n",
    "    *   **Examples:**\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        for i in range(1, 10, 2):\n",
    "            print(i, end=' ')\n",
    "        # Output: 1 3 5 7 9\n",
    "\n",
    "        for i in range(10, 0, -1):\n",
    "            print(i, end=' ')\n",
    "        # Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Integer Arguments Only:** All arguments (`start`, `stop`, `step`) must be integers. Floating-point numbers are not allowed.\n",
    "*   **Exclusive `stop`:** The `stop` value is *never* included in the generated sequence.\n",
    "*   **Memory Efficiency:** `range()` objects are very memory efficient because they only store the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values, calculating numbers on the fly rather than storing all numbers in memory.\n",
    "*   **Iterable, Not Iterator:** A `range` object is iterable, meaning you can loop over it multiple times, and it will generate the sequence each time. You can convert it to a list using `list(range(...))` if you need all the numbers explicitly stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the output of `range(-5)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the rule for `range(stop)`:\n",
    "*   It starts from `0`.\n",
    "*   It goes up to, but not including, `stop`.\n",
    "*   The step is `1` (positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "When `stop` is `-5`, the sequence is supposed to start at `0` and increment by `1` until it reaches a value *less than* `-5`. However, `0` is already greater than `-5`. Since the sequence starts at `0` and tries to move towards a negative `stop` with a positive `step`, it immediately realizes that `0` is not less than `-5`, and thus, no numbers can be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `range(-5)` generates an **empty sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's confirm this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(list(range(-5)))\n",
    "# Output: []\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or in a loop:\n",
    "for num in range(-5):\n",
    "    print(num) # This line will never execute\n",
    "print(\"Loop finished.\")\n",
    "# Output: Loop finished.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It correctly produces an empty list, indicating that no numbers are generated by `range(-5)`."

    "### The 'For Each' Concept in Python (`for` loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, you might encounter a `for each` loop construct specifically designed to iterate over elements in a collection (like arrays or lists). In Python, the standard `for` loop inherently acts as a 'for each' loop, making it very intuitive and powerful for iterating over any **iterable** object.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **iterable** is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time. This includes:\n",
    "*   Lists (`[]`)\n",
    "*   Tuples (`()`)\n",
    "*   Strings (`\"\"`)\n",
    "*   Dictionaries (`{}`)\n",
    "*   Sets (`{}`)\n",
    "*   `range()` objects\n",
    "*   File objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for a `for` loop in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in iterable:\n",
    "    # code block to execute for each item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "*   `item` is a variable that takes on the value of the next element in the `iterable` during each iteration.\n",
    "*   `iterable` is the collection or sequence you want to loop through.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop iterates over the `iterable` from left to right, assigning each element in turn to the `item` variable, and then executes the code block for that `item`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Iterating over a List:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "    for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "        print(fruit)\n",
    "    # Output:\n",
    "    # apple\n",
    "    # banana\n",
    "    # cherry\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Iterating over a String:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    word = \"Python\"\n",
    "    for char in word:\n",
    "        print(char, end=\"-\")\n",
    "    # Output:\n",
    "    # P-y-t-h-o-n-\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Iterating over a Tuple:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    coordinates = (10, 20, 30)\n",
    "    for coord in coordinates:\n",
    "        print(f\"Coordinate: {coord}\")\n",
    "    # Output:\n",
    "    # Coordinate: 10\n",
    "    # Coordinate: 20\n",
    "    # Coordinate: 30\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Iterating over a Dictionary (Keys):**\n",
    "    By default, iterating over a dictionary iterates through its keys.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ages = {\"Alice\": 30, \"Bob\": 24, \"Charlie\": 35}\n",
    "    for name in ages:\n",
    "        print(name)\n",
    "    # Output:\n",
    "    # Alice\n",
    "    # Bob\n",
    "    # Charlie\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Iterating over a Dictionary (Values):**\n",
    "    You can use the `.values()` method to iterate through values.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ages = {\"Alice\": 30, \"Bob\": 24, \"Charlie\": 35}\n",
    "    for age in ages.values():\n",
    "        print(age)\n",
    "    # Output:\n",
    "    # 30\n",
    "    # 24\n",
    "    # 35\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Iterating over a Dictionary (Key-Value Pairs):**\n",
    "    You can use the `.items()` method to iterate through both keys and values as tuples.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ages = {\"Alice\": 30, \"Bob\": 24, \"Charlie\": 35}\n",
    "    for name, age in ages.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{name} is {age} years old.\")\n",
    "    # Output:\n",
    "    # Alice is 30 years old.\n",
    "    # Bob is 24 years old.\n",
    "    # Charlie is 35 years old.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Iterating with `enumerate()` (Index and Value):**\n",
    "    The `enumerate()` function is useful when you need both the index and the value of each item.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n",
    "    for index, color in enumerate(colors):\n",
    "        print(f\"Color at index {index}: {color}\")\n",
    "    # Output:\n",
    "    # Color at index 0: red\n",
    "    # Color at index 1: green\n",
    "    # Color at index 2: blue\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `for` loop is highly versatile and is the primary way to perform 'for each' style iteration over collections and other iterable objects."

    "### The `match` and `case` Statements (Structural Pattern Matching) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced in Python 3.10, the `match` statement (also known as structural pattern matching) allows you to compare a value against several different patterns. It's a powerful control flow statement that can simplify complex `if/elif/else` chains, especially when dealing with data structures or different types of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "match subject:\n",
    "    case pattern1:\n",
    "        # Code to execute if subject matches pattern1\n",
    "    case pattern2:\n",
    "        # Code to execute if subject matches pattern2\n",
    "    case _:\n",
    "        # Optional: default case (wildcard), if no other pattern matches\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`subject`**: The expression whose value is being compared.\n",
    "*   **`case`**: Each `case` keyword is followed by a `pattern`.\n",
    "*   **`pattern`**: A structure that the `subject` is compared against. If the `subject` matches the `pattern`, the code block under that `case` executes.\n",
    "*   **`_` (wildcard)**: The underscore acts as a wildcard pattern, matching anything. It's typically used as the final `case` to provide a default action if no other patterns match, similar to `else` in an `if/elif/else` chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features and Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Literal Patterns:** Matching exact values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    status_code = 200\n",
    "\n",
    "    match status_code:\n",
    "        case 200:\n",
    "            print(\"OK\")\n",
    "        case 404:\n",
    "            print(\"Not Found\")\n",
    "        case 500:\n",
    "            print(\"Internal Server Error\")\n",
    "        case _:\n",
    "            print(\"Unknown Status\")\n",
    "    # Output: OK\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Capture Patterns:** Assigning the matched value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    command = (\"move\", 10, 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "    match command:\n",
    "        case (\"move\", x, y):\n",
    "            print(f\"Moving to ({x}, {y})\")\n",
    "        case (\"jump\", height):\n",
    "            print(f\"Jumping to height {height}\")\n",
    "        case _:\n",
    "            print(\"Unknown command\")\n",
    "    # Output: Moving to (10, 20)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **OR Patterns (`|`):** Matching multiple patterns with a single case.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    day = \"Sunday\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    match day:\n",
    "        case \"Saturday\" | \"Sunday\":\n",
    "            print(\"It's the weekend!\")\n",
    "        case _:\n",
    "            print(\"It's a weekday.\")\n",
    "    # Output: It's the weekend!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Guard Clauses (`if`):** Adding an `if` condition to a `case` pattern for more specific matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    point = (5, 12)\n",
    "\n",
    "    match point:\n",
    "        case (x, y) if x == y:\n",
    "            print(f\"Point on diagonal: ({x}, {y})\")\n",
    "        case (x, y) if x > y:\n",
    "            print(f\"Point above diagonal: ({x}, {y})\")\n",
    "        case (x, y):\n",
    "            print(f\"Point below diagonal: ({x}, {y})\")\n",
    "    # Output: Point below diagonal: (5, 12)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Class and Dictionary Patterns:** Matching against object attributes or dictionary keys/values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Event:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, type, data):\n",
    "            self.type = type\n",
    "            self.data = data\n",
    "\n",
    "    event1 = Event(\"click\", {\"x\": 10, \"y\": 20})\n",
    "    event2 = Event(\"hover\", {\"element\": \"button\"})\n",
    "\n",

    "### Differences in Execution: `switch-case` vs. Python's `match-case`\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to clarify that Python does not have a traditional `switch-case` statement. Instead, it offers **Structural Pattern Matching** with `match-case`, which is significantly more powerful. Here's a comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `switch-case` (as found in languages like C, Java, JavaScript)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Value-Based Matching:** Primarily designed for matching a single variable's value against a set of discrete, constant values.\n",
    "    *   **Execution:** The `switch` expression is evaluated once. Its result is then compared sequentially (or via optimized jump tables) against the `case` values for equality.\n",
    "2.  **Fall-through Behavior:** In many languages, `switch-case` exhibits \"fall-through\" by default. If a `case` matches, its code block executes, and execution continues into subsequent `case` blocks unless explicitly stopped with a `break` statement.\n",
    "    *   **Execution:** If `break` is omitted, the code from the matching `case` and all following `case`s will execute until a `break` or the end of the `switch` block is reached. This is a common source of bugs if not handled carefully.\n",
    "3.  **Limited Pattern Types:** Typically supports matching against simple data types like integers, characters, strings, or enums. Complex data structures cannot be directly matched or decomposed.\n",
    "4.  **No Direct Decomposition:** You cannot easily extract parts of a complex value directly within a `case`.\n",
    "5.  **Default Case:** Uses a `default` keyword to handle any values that don't match an explicit `case`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python's `match-case` (Structural Pattern Matching - Python 3.10+)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Pattern-Based Matching:** Far more sophisticated. It matches a `subject` against various **patterns**, not just simple values.\n",
    "    *   **Execution:** The `match` subject is evaluated. Python then attempts to match the subject against each `case` pattern from top to bottom. The *first* pattern that successfully matches is executed.\n",
    "2.  **No Fall-through:** Python's `match-case` does **not** have fall-through behavior. Once a `case` pattern matches and its block executes, the entire `match` statement is exited. No `break` is needed.\n",
    "    *   **Execution:** Only the code block corresponding to the first successful match is executed.\n",
    "3.  **Rich Pattern Types:** Can match against a wide array of structures:\n",
    "    *   **Literals:** (`case 10:`, `case \"hello\":`)\n",
    "    *   **Sequences:** (e.g., `case [x, y]:`, `case (x, y, z):`)\n",
    "    *   **Mappings:** (e.g., `case {'key': value}:`)\n",
    "    *   **Objects:** (e.g., `case MyClass(attribute=value):`)\n",
    "    *   **Capture Patterns:** (e.g., `case (x, y):` where `x` and `y` capture parts of a sequence)\n",
    "    *   **OR Patterns:** (e.g., `case \"red\" | \"blue\":`)\n",
    "    *   **Guard Clauses:** (e.g., `case x if x > 10:` for conditional matching)\n",
    "4.  **Data Decomposition and Binding:** A core feature is its ability to decompose data structures and bind extracted values to variables directly within the `case` pattern. This significantly reduces boilerplate code for unpacking complex data.\n",
    "5.  **Wildcard Pattern:** Uses the `_` (underscore) as a wildcard to represent a default or catch-all case if no other patterns match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Execution Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Complexity of Matching:** `switch-case` performs simple equality checks; `match-case` performs structural analysis and decomposition of data.\n",
    "*   **Flow Control:** `switch-case` often requires explicit `break` for desired flow; `match-case` inherently executes only one block and exits.\n",
    "*   **Flexibility:** `match-case` is far more flexible and expressive, capable of handling complex data shapes and logic that would require many `if/elif/else` statements or manual unpacking with a traditional `switch-case` equivalent."

    "### Understanding Negative Indices in Python Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can access individual characters within a string using indexing. While positive indices start from `0` for the first character and go up to `length - 1` for the last character, negative indices provide a convenient way to access characters from the *end* of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Negative Indexing Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`-1`**: Refers to the **last** character of the string.\n",
    "*   **`-2`**: Refers to the **second to last** character of the string.\n",
    "*   **`-n`**: Refers to the `n`-th character from the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a negative index `-n` is equivalent to a positive index `length - n` (where `length` is the total number of characters in the string).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the string `\"Python\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "String: P y t h o n\n",
    "Positive: 0 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "Negative: -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a string `my_string = \"hello\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `my_string[0]` would give `'h'`\n",
    "*   `my_string[4]` would give `'o'`\n",
    "*   `my_string[-1]` would give `'o'` (the last character)\n",
    "*   `my_string[-2]` would give `'l'` (the second to last character)\n",
    "*   `my_string[-5]` would give `'h'` (the fifth from the end, which is the first character)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Negative Indices?\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative indices are particularly useful when you need to access characters from the end of a string without knowing its exact length. For instance, to get the last character, you can always use `[-1]` instead of calculating `[len(my_string) - 1]`."

    "#### Return Value:\n",
    "An integer, representing the number of items in the object. If the object does not define a length, a `TypeError` will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Sets:** Returns the number of unique elements in the set.\n",

    "### Comprehensive Explanation of String Slicing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**String slicing** is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extract a portion (a \"slice\") of a string. It's a very flexible way to work with substrings without modifying the original string (remember, strings are immutable!).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for string slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`string[start:end:step]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "*   `string`: The original string you want to slice.\n",
    "*   `start`: (Optional) The index where the slice begins. The character at this index *is included* in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to `0` (the beginning of the string).\n",
    "*   `end`: (Optional) The index where the slice ends. The character at this index *is not included* in the slice (exclusive). If omitted, it defaults to `len(string)` (the end of the string).\n",
    "*   `step`: (Optional) The increment between indices. It determines how many characters to skip. If omitted, it defaults to `1`. A negative step reverses the string or a portion of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Indexing Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Positive Indices:** Start from `0` for the first character, `1` for the second, and so on, up to `len(string) - 1`.\n",
    "*   **Negative Indices:** Start from `-1` for the last character, `-2` for the second to last, and so on, up to `-len(string)` for the first character.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "String: H e l l o   W o r l d\n",
    "Positive: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n",
    "Negative: -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Breakdown and Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Basic Slicing (`[start:end]`)**\n",
    "    *   Extracts characters from `start` up to (but not including) `end`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_string = \"Python\"\n",
    "    print(my_string[0:2])  # Output: \"Py\" (from index 0 to 1)\n",
    "    print(my_string[2:5])  # Output: \"tho\" (from index 2 to 4)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Omitting `start` (defaults to 0)**\n",
    "    *   Slices from the beginning of the string up to (but not including) `end`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_string = \"Python\"\n",
    "    print(my_string[:3])   # Output: \"Pyt\" (from beginning to index 2)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Omitting `end` (defaults to `len(string)`)**\n",
    "    *   Slices from `start` to the end of the string.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_string = \"Python\"\n",
    "    print(my_string[3:])   # Output: \"hon\" (from index 3 to end)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Omitting both `start` and `end` (`[:]`)**\n",
    "    *   Creates a full copy of the string.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_string = \"Python\"\n",
    "    print(my_string[:])    # Output: \"Python\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Using Negative Indices in `start` and `end`**\n",
    "    *   Useful for slicing from the end of the string.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_string = \"HelloWorld\"\n",
    "    print(my_string[-5:])  # Output: \"World\" (last 5 characters)\n",
    "    print(my_string[:-5]) # Output: \"Hello\" (all but the last 5 characters)\n",
    "    print(my_string[-8:-3])# Output: \"llo Wo\" (from 'l' at -8 to 'o' at -4)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Using `step` (`[start:end:step]`)**\n",
    "    *   Determines the increment after extracting each character.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_string = \"abcdefg\"\n",
    "    print(my_string[::2])  # Output: \"aceg\" (every second character)\n",
    "    print(my_string[1::2]) # Output: \"bdf\" (every second character, starting from index 1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Negative `step` (Reversing Strings/Slices)**\n",
    "    *   A common and idiomatic way to reverse a string.\n",
    "    *   When `step` is negative, `start` defaults to `len(string) - 1` and `end` defaults to `-len(string) - 1` (conceptually, one position before the start of the string), allowing traversal from right to left.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_string = \"Python\"\n",
    "    print(my_string[::-1]) # Output: \"nohtyP\" (reverses the entire string)\n",
    "    print(my_string[4:1:-1])# Output: \"oht\" (from index 4 down to 2)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "*   **New String Object:** Slicing always creates a *new* string object. The original string remains unchanged.\n",
    "*   **Out-of-Bounds Handling:** If `start` or `end` indices are out of the string's bounds, Python handles it gracefully without raising an error. It simply slices up to the actual boundary.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. `str.find(sub[, start[, end]])`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Searches for the first occurrence of the `sub`string within the string `str`. It returns the lowest index in the string where `sub` is found.\n",
    "*   **Behavior on Not Found:** If the `sub`string is not found, `find()` returns `-1`.\n",
    "*   **Optional Arguments:**\n",
    "    *   `start`: The index from which to start the search. (Inclusive)\n",
    "    *   `end`: The index at which to stop the search. (Exclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"hello world, hello Python\"\n",
    "print(text.find(\"hello\"))         # Output: 0\n",
    "print(text.find(\"world\"))         # Output: 6\n",
    "print(text.find(\"Python\"))        # Output: 13\n",
    "print(text.find(\"Java\"))           # Output: -1 (not found)\n",

    "print(text.find(\"world\", 0, 5))   # Output: -1 (not found within 'hello')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Difference between `find()` and `index()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference lies in their behavior when the `sub`string is *not* found:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`find()` returns `-1`**. This allows you to check for existence without needing `try-except` blocks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Choose `find()` if you just want to know if a substring exists or its position, and can handle a `-1` result. Choose `index()` if the absence of the substring is an error condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `str.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Searches for the *last* occurrence of the `sub`string within the string. It returns the highest index in the string where `sub` is found.\n",

    "*   **Optional Arguments:** Similar to `find()` and `index()`, `start` and `end` can limit the search range.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. `str.ljust(width[, fillchar])`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Returns a new string of a specified `width`. The original string is left-justified within this width, and the remaining space on the right is filled with `fillchar` (a single character, defaulting to a space).\n",

    "    *   If `width` is less than or equal to the length of the original string, the original string is returned unchanged.\n",
    "    *   If `fillchar` is not provided, spaces are used for padding.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of `old` substring replaced by `new` substring.\n",
    "*   **Behavior:**\n",
    "    *   If `count` is provided, only the first `count` occurrences are replaced.\n",
    "    *   If `old` is not found, the original string is returned unchanged.\n",
    "    *   Returns a *new* string; the original string is immutable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. `str.join(iterable)`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Concatenates an iterable of strings using the string itself as a separator. It's often considered more efficient than using `+` for multiple concatenations.\n",
    "*   **Behavior:**\n",
    "    *   The `iterable` must contain only string elements. If it contains non-string elements, a `TypeError` will be raised.\n",

    "*   **Behavior:**\n",
    "    *   If `sep` is not specified or is `None`, whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) are used as separators. Multiple consecutive whitespace characters are treated as a single separator, and leading/trailing whitespace is ignored, resulting in no empty strings at the beginning or end of the list.\n",
    "    *   If `sep` is provided, it's used as the delimiter. Consecutive `sep`s will result in empty strings in the list.\n",

    "*   **Behavior:** It's locale-independent and handles characters that might not have a direct lowercase equivalent in simple `lower()` (e.g., the German sharp s 'ß' becomes 'ss'). It's ideal for comparisons where case should be ignored, especially across different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "print(text.casefold())    # Output: 'hello world'\n",
    "\n",
    "text2 = \"Straße\" # German for 'street'\n",
    "print(text2.lower())      # Output: 'straße'\n",
    "print(text2.casefold())   # Output: 'strasse'\n",
    "\n",
    "text3 = \"ΣΤΡΑΤΟΣ\" # Greek for 'army'\n",
    "print(text3.lower())      # Output: 'στρατος'\n",
    "print(text3.casefold())   # Output: 'στρατοσ' (Note: the final 's' becomes sigma-final)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use `lower()` vs. `casefold()`:**\n",
    "*   Use `lower()` for general purpose lowercasing, especially if you're primarily dealing with ASCII characters or want to retain some subtle case differences in non-ASCII text.\n",
    "*   Use `casefold()` when performing case-insensitive comparisons, particularly if your text might contain characters from various languages and you need the most robust form of caseless matching."

    "### Python String Inquiry Methods (Character Type and Case Checks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python strings provide a rich set of methods to inquire about their content, character types, and casing. These methods are invaluable for validating user input, parsing data, and ensuring text consistency. They typically return `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Case-Related Inquiry Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.islower()`:** Returns `True` if all cased characters in the string are lowercase and there is at least one cased character, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"hello\".islower())     # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\".islower())     # Output: False\n",
    "    print(\"123\".islower())       # Output: False (no cased characters)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isupper()`:** Returns `True` if all cased characters in the string are uppercase and there is at least one cased character, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"HELLO\".isupper())     # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\".isupper())     # Output: False\n",
    "    print(\"123\".isupper())       # Output: False\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.istitle()`:** Returns `True` if the string is titlecased (first letter of each word is uppercase, rest are lowercase) and there is at least one cased character, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World\".istitle()) # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"Hello world\".istitle()) # Output: False\n",
    "    print(\"python\".istitle())      # Output: False\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Character Type Inquiry Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isalpha()`:** Returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise. (Alphabetic includes letters from different languages).\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"Python\".isalpha())    # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"Python123\".isalpha()) # Output: False\n",
    "    print(\"\".isalpha())          # Output: False (empty string)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isdigit()`:** Returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise. Digits include Unicode digits, e.g., '²' (superscript two).\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"123\".isdigit())       # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"123.45\".isdigit())    # Output: False (contains '.')\n",
    "    print(\"²\".isdigit())         # Output: True\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isalnum()`:** Returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (alphabets or digits) and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"Python123\".isalnum()) # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"Python 123\".isalnum())# Output: False (contains space)\n",
    "    print(\"-\".isalnum())         # Output: False\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isspace()`:** Returns `True` if all characters in the string are whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, etc.) and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\" \".isspace())         # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"\\t\\n\".isspace())      # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"  a  \".isspace())     # Output: False\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isdecimal()`:** Returns `True` if all characters in the string are decimal characters (Unicode digits that can be used to form base-10 numbers) and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise. A subset of `isdigit()`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"123\".isdecimal())     # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"²\".isdecimal())       # Output: False (superscript is digit but not decimal)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isnumeric()`:** Returns `True` if all characters in the string are numeric characters (includes digits, decimal characters, and characters that have a numeric value, such as fractions) and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise. A superset of `isdigit()`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"123\".isnumeric())     # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"²\".isnumeric())       # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"½\".isnumeric())       # Output: True (fraction)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Other Inquiry Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isidentifier()`:** Returns `True` if the string is a valid Python identifier (e.g., variable names, function names), `False` otherwise. An identifier must start with a letter or an underscore and contain only alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"my_variable\".isidentifier()) # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"1variable\".isidentifier())   # Output: False (starts with digit)\n",
    "    print(\"my-variable\".isidentifier()) # Output: False (contains hyphen)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`str.isprintable()`:** Returns `True` if all characters in the string are printable or the string is empty, `False` otherwise. Non-printable characters include control characters (e.g., newline, carriage return, tab).\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World\".isprintable()) # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\\nWorld\".isprintable()) # Output: False (contains newline)\n",
    "    print(\"\".isprintable())          # Output: True\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These inquiry methods are fundamental for robust string processing in Python, allowing you to easily check various conditions without manual character-by-character validation."
